All the gains from 1974 has been all for naught, as your loss had led many congresspeople to have a very untimely retirement. On the national stage, the party is looking for someone that will win them back the Oval Office. Senator Mondale perhaps? Or maybe Ted Kennedy? Who knows what 1980 will have in store. For now, the American public will surely be keen to see how President Ford fares as he moves America away from its national nightmares."

But it’s not all terrible. Despite some of your controversial policies and gaffes, you’ve managed to carry a few Electoral College-heavy states in your column, proving that there is some part of the electorate that is warm to your agenda. You give a rather optimistic concession speech at your campaign headquarters, something par for the course, to raucous applause. With the ‘80 campaign in the far future, it seems that a nice retirement is in order unless, of course, you can somehow find it in yourself to run again.<p>After this election, the Democratic Party is, while still massively disappointed, buoyant for now. Maybe they can pick some mainstream liberal or moderate to win back the White House, but with two progressives nominated back-to-back and your inroads, the primary season is going to be competitive to say the least. With this eventful campaign season coming to a close, President Ford will have a busy four years. Let’s hope America can look forward, heading into the 1980s stronger than ever before."

From the Silver Screen to Sacramento, you’ve managed to narrowly win the White House. The Ford campaign might be asking for some recounts in some razor-thin states, but you’ve still won nonetheless with the American public on your side. Be prepared to haggle and be needled on your policies from a wide ideological coalition, but that’s weeks from now. Savor your victory as much as you can.<p>As you wind down from your victory speech, it’s not too early to plan a domestic policy package with a catchy moniker. You’ll need a lot of help against a tepid to vitriolic Congress, but maybe you’ll at least be able to fulfill the late President Truman’s universal healthcare dream or clean up the pollution in the metro areas.<p>Whatever the case may be, here’s to you Ron! If everything goes well, 1980 will be nothing short of a cakewalk."

From the Silver Screen to Sacramento, you’ve now clasped the White House. As First Lady Betty Ford bitterly grins as she gives the President’s concession speech, your election headquarters is roaring with your devoted supporters. All the while, your phone is ringing off the hook with everyone from Senator McGovern to Vice President Rockefeller congratulating you on your comfortable victory. Sure, come January, politics will continue as usual, but tonight, just bask in your victory.<p>With this mandate in tow, the American people and (most) Democrats are expecting you to make true to your promises during the campaign trail. Start drawing up nicknames for your domestic agenda and be ready to market it to the American people. Congress will most certainly be unfriendly to your policies, but you’ve accepted that the moment you got into politics, didn’t you? Get ready to meet with senators and representatives to pass civil rights, healthcare, and environmental legislation.<p>Here’s to you, Ron! If you can carry this momentum throughout your term, I pity whomever the GOP fields in 1980."

From the Silver Screen to Sacramento, you’ve now won the White House with what is a landslide victory. As First Lady Betty Ford bitterly huffs out the President’s concession speech, your election headquarters is flooding with confetti and cheers from your roaring supporters. All the while, your phone is ringing off the hook with everyone from Senator McGovern to Vice President Rockefeller congratulating you on your massive victory. Some conservatives are already publishing op-eds claiming that the Red Terror has seized 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, with some even declaring that Soviet collusion was involved, but all your aides just scoff and snark at their remarks. Tonight will surely be one for the history books.<p>As you prepare to move into the White House with your large mandate from the American people, a few hundred soon-to-be White House staffers, aides, and policy-drafters are waiting in the wings. Ready your domestic agenda and a suave name for it. Congress will most certainly be unhappy with your ambitious ideas, but your victory tonight has kicked Senate and House Republicans to the curb and sent chills through the more reluctant members of your party, perhaps convincing them into voting in line from healthcare to unions to the environment if they want to have jobs come ‘78.<p>Here’s to you, Ron! Whatever sacrificial lamb is nominated in 1980, they’ll surely be sent packing."

So much had changed, yet not enough to make a significant difference. Millions of Americans sat in poverty without a proper helping hand, whose only use was to die in some war by some vulgar Texan or some Californian crook, but not now.<p>He recalled stumping for Presidents Roosevelt and Truman in their election bids during his old radio days. Whether it be a scion of a powerful political dynasty or just a rural farm boy from the middle of nowhere, anyone could wield one of the most powerful offices in the world. And now, he would wield that office with such a mandate in tow that neither ever had. In spite of everything, the people of California, the Democratic Party, and now the American people had indicated their confidence in him with just about unanimous approval.<p>As Reagan stepped up to the podium with uproarious applause, he laid out his agenda in full, speaking with the grace and charisma that had carried him this far. Finally, the decades-long change that America so desperately needed has arrived, and that coalition of gutless liberals, tepid moderates, and embittered conservatives could do nothing but watch."
